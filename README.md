## üìä Project Purpose & Context

### Why This Project Matters
In the lending industry, the difference between a good and bad loan can significantly impact profitability. Traditional credit scoring methods often miss subtle patterns that indicate default risk. This project bridges the gap between:
- **Traditional Banking**: Regulatory-compliant, interpretable models
- **Modern ML**: High-performance algorithms that capture complex patterns
- **Business Reality**: Actionable insights that directly reduce losses

### The Challenge
Create a credit risk model that:
1. **Accurately predicts loan defaults** before they happen
2. **Remains interpretable** for regulatory compliance (FCRA, ECOA)
3. **Provides actionable segmentation** for business decisions
4. **Scales to millions** of loan applications

## üìÅ Dataset Deep Dive

### Overview
The dataset represents **887,379 real loan applications** with their 3-year performance outcomes:
- **Source**: Historical loan data from a major U.S. lending platform
- **Time Period**: Multi-year lending history with complete performance tracking
- **Features**: 74 original features covering:
  - **Applicant Profile**: Income, employment, home ownership
  - **Credit History**: FICO scores, credit lines, delinquencies
  - **Loan Characteristics**: Amount, term, interest rate, purpose
  - **Behavioral Data**: Recent inquiries, credit utilization patterns

### Target Variable Distribution
- **Good Loans (Fully Paid/Current)**: 811,490 (93.0%)
- **Bad Loans (Default/Charged Off)**: 61,176 (7.0%)
- **Imbalance Ratio**: 13.3:1

This severe class imbalance reflects real-world lending where most loans perform well, making accurate bad loan prediction both challenging and valuable.

### Data Quality Insights
- **Missing Values**: Intelligently handled 40 features with missing data
- **Temporal Features**: Converted dates to meaningful durations (e.g., credit history length)
- **High Cardinality**: Addressed features like zip codes and employment titles
- **Data Leakage**: Removed 25 features containing future information

## üöÄ Technical Approach & Innovation

### 1. **Advanced Feature Engineering** (96 Features Created)

The heart of this project's success lies in domain-driven feature engineering:

#### Financial Health Indicators
- **Debt Service Coverage**: Monthly obligations vs. available income
- **Payment Shock**: How much the new loan increases monthly obligations  
- **Income Stability**: Proxied through verification status and employment length
- **Credit Capacity**: Unused credit as a buffer indicator

#### Behavioral Risk Signals
- **Credit Hunger**: Recent inquiries relative to credit history
- **Utilization Patterns**: Non-linear risk buckets (0%, 1-30%, 30-70%, 70%+)
- **Account Velocity**: Rate of new account openings
- **Derogatory Density**: Negative marks per year of credit history

#### Statistical Enhancements
- **Interaction Effects**: Combined high interest + high debt burden
- **Non-linear Transformations**: Captured diminishing returns in income
- **Percentile Rankings**: Relative positioning for robust comparisons

### 2. **Weight of Evidence (WOE) Transformation**

Implemented sophisticated binning strategy:
- **Optimal Binning**: Decision tree-based splits maximizing IV
- **Monotonic Constraints**: Ensuring logical risk ordering
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Separate bins for unknowns
- **Result**: 46 WOE features with IV > 0.02

Top 5 WOE Features by Information Value:
1. **is_credit_mature** (IV: 0.152) - 10+ years of credit history
2. **clean_history** (IV: 0.144) - No derogatory marks
3. **mths_since_last_record** (IV: 0.114) - Time since last negative event
4. **has_derog** (IV: 0.067) - Binary derogatory indicator
5. **debt_consolidation_high_rate** (IV: 0.052) - Risky refinancing

### 3. **Model Development & Selection**

Developed multiple models for different use cases:

| Model | AUC | Use Case |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Logistic Regression (WOE) | 0.787 | **Regulatory Compliance** - Full interpretability |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.816 | **Benchmark** - Traditional ensemble |
| LightGBM (Raw Features) | 0.828 | **Performance** - Modern gradient boosting |
| **LightGBM (Tuned)** | **0.836** | **Production** - Optimized for deployment |

### 4. **Hyperparameter Optimization Journey**

Conducted extensive grid search with stratified k-fold validation:
```python
Final Parameters (LightGBM):
- n_estimators: 300 (balanced training time vs performance)
- learning_rate: 0.07 (optimal convergence rate)
- num_leaves: 64 (capturing interactions without overfitting)
- max_depth: 2 (preventing overfitting on 7% minority class)
- min_child_samples: 60 (regularization for stability)
- subsample: 0.5 (bagging for generalization)
```

## üìà Results & Business Impact

### Model Performance Metrics
- **AUC-ROC**: 0.836 (Excellent - 68% better than random)
- **KS Statistic**: 0.424 (Strong separation at 40-45% of distribution)
- **Gini Coefficient**: 0.575 (High concentration of risk)

### Credit Score Distribution
- **Score Range**: 454 - 779 points
- **Mean Score**: 587.8 (std: 54.5)

### Risk Segmentation Results
The model creates five distinct risk tiers with dramatically different default rates:

| Risk Segment | Score Range | Loan Count | Default Rate | Relative Risk |
|--------------|-------------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Very High Risk | < 545 | 177,476 | 19.3% | 15.4x |
| High Risk | 545-574 | 177,476 | 8.8% | 7.0x |
| Medium Risk | 574-608 | 177,476 | 4.8% | 3.8x |
| Low Risk | 608-650 | 177,476 | 2.1% | 1.7x |
| Very Low Risk | > 650 | 177,475 | 0.4% | 0.3x |

  - Portfolio: $80,000,000 (20% fewer loans)
  - Expected Defaults: 4.0% (43% improvement)
  - **Annual Expected Loss: $1,440,000**
  - **Annual Savings: $1,710,000**
